    <p>HThis is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. 
        You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you’re reading this 
        from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right 
        corner of your screen. Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in 
        earlier chapters. You can learn most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters 
        in the order they appear in the sidebar. For example, “Introducing JSX” is the next chapter
         after this one.</p>
